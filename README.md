# Mini-Grep-CLI-app
Implementation of the Grep filter in Rust.
The grep filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern.
The pattern that is searched in the file is referred to as the regular expression (grep stands for global search for regular expression and print out).

The filter has the functionality to search for both case sensitive and insentive texts.
