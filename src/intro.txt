Hey there!
My name is Prathmesh Ranjan.
I'm a second year student at LNMIIT, Jaipur, India pursuing a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
I'm  currently learning Rust and Blockchain development.
I'm comfortable in languages like Java, Solidity, JavaScript, HTML and CSS besides Rust.
I've developed dApps and onChain NFTs before and currently a blockchain intern at AirBrils.
Thank you for your time.
Hope you have a good day. 
Goodbye!
